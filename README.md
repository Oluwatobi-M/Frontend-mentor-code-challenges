## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS responsive layout with the application of flex


### What I learned

The major thing i've learnt is the way the different units of width and height affects the responsiveness of the container been styled and the page


### Continued development

Mostly i would like to practice on using flexbox and grid more as well as adding a layer of interactivity using javascript
